The UI assets under this directory are vendorized from the
production build of the Jaeger UI 2.14.1 release.

Why not 2.15+:

Jaeger UI 2.15+ started using `/api/v3/*` for parts of trace discovery (e.g.
services and operations). This project currently implements a minimal legacy
`/api/*` compatibility layer, so upgrading to 2.15+ may break those flows.
